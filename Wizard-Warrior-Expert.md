# Wizard Warrior Expert

This is a game of exploration, armed combat, and arcane investigation. In it, you assume the mantle of either a *WIZARD*, a *WARRIOR* or an *EXPERT*, and try your luck against the weird wilderness of a largely undiscovered land.

Characters are defined by **PATHS** (a role and a set of abilities), their **ATTRIBUTES** and their **ASSETS** (a collection of tools, gear, and relationships which aid the character in their pursuits).

Challenges are overcome either by creative thinking on the part of the player or a resolved dice roll on behalf of the character or the environment. Creative solutions should be rewarded wherever possible. Dice are rolled in base pools of 3d6, and are modified either by the addition or subtraction of a single d6 or the application of a modifier in the range of -3/+3.

## Attributes

Players roll `3d6` three times, assigning the sum of the three dice rolled to each of the three prime attributes, in whichever order they prefer. If an `18` is rolled, subtract three from the next roll (minimum score is 3) and if a `3` is rolled, add three to the next roll (maximum score is `18`). If a `3` or an `18` is rolled for the final attribute, adjust the highest or lowest previous score by three, towards the average. Each attribute will have a score (ranging between 3 and 18) and a bonus (ranging between -3 and +3). The three attributes are **MIND**,** BODY**, and **SPIRIT**. A chart containing the pluses and bonuses is below:

| Score |Bonus|
|------ |-----|
| 3     | -3  |
| 4-6   | -2  |
| 7-9   | -1  |
| 10-11 | 0   |
| 12-14 | +1  |
| 15-17 | +2  |
| 18    | +3  |

### Mind

The Mind attribute describes a character’s aptitude for intellectual pursuits such as research, mechanical understanding, problem solving, deduction, and perception.

### Body

The Body attribute describes a character’s physical capacities: their strength, agility, speed, physical constitution.

### Spirit

The Spirit attribute describes a character's sense of virtue, their resolve, their closeness to the unseen world, their empathetic capacity, and their connection to nature.

## Paths

Players choose paths at the beginning of play, after rolling for their base attributes.

### The Wizard

The Wizard knows what no other mortal dares even guess: that the world we see and touch and hear is an illusion; that there is only a great thrumming and the light beyond the stars. Having confronted this great terror, either through lengthy meditation, long study, or a chance encounter with the Wyrd, the Wizard is able to attune herself to this primal vibration and, if she is strong, warp and wend the illusion of reality to reflect her desire.

#### Attunement
Attunement is the defining attribute of the Wizard. It describes his or her innate or acquired connection with and influence over the Great Thrumming which constitutes reality. By manipulating this pool of resources, the Wizard can transmute matter, manipulate time and space, and touch the souls of men.

Wizards begin with 3 points of attunement.

#### Arcanum
The Wizard begins with a special asset, called an Arcanum. The Arcanum is a talisman or totem which connects the Wizard to the Wyrd, and which acts as a conduit between her will and the Great Thrumming. It has a life of its own, animate or not, and the Wizard feels its presence as one feels the teeth in ones head. Without it, the Wizard is a fortune teller, a pedant, a peddler of cheap tricks.

#### Wizardry
Through a combination of Attunement and the skillful use of Arcanum the Wizard is able to perform acts of Wizardry: miraculous feats which defy the laws of nature, and expose the plastic nature of the real. To achieve these ends the Wizard must state the scope of his ambition, the nature of his effect, and the persistence of his creation. Each element of the act of Wizardy will be rated by the Referee on a scale between 1 (for minor or limited effects) and 3 (being great and powerful effects). The sum of these ratings (ranging from 3 to 9) will be added to a roll of 3d6. If the roll is below the Wizards Spirit Attribute, the Wizardry succeeds. For each point by which the roll exceeds the Wizard's Spirit attribute, the Wizards suffers one point of Spirit Fatigue.

### The Warrior

The Warrior knows what other mortals fear beyond all else: that life is fleeting, that death is the end, and that The Ways of Blood have written all our history. Having pledged herself to The Ways and The End, the Warrior sees clearly the path before her, and woe betide those who would stand in her way; by blade or bow they will fall as wheat before the mower.

#### Valor
Valor is the defining attribute of the true Warrior. It describes her acceptance of fate and her determination to fulfill her destiny. This pool gives the Warrior access to a reservoir of strength and endurance (mental and physical) which is beyond the scope of most men, and inures her to the slings and arrows of life as an adventurer

Warriors begin with 3 points of Valor

#### Blood Relic
Warriors begin with a special asset: a Blood Relic. The Blood Relic is an implement of war which is a symbolic and spiritual reminder of the Warrior's ultimate destiny and true calling. It is as familiar to the Warrior as a limb, or a sibling. Without it, the warrior becomes nothing more than a thug, a mercenary, a roughneck.

#### Heroics


### The Expert

The Expert knows the same thing everything else does: that the world is cruel and inscrutable, that man builds the world he wishes to live in, and that the odds are always against you. Having lived and learned in a world unfriendly to both endeavors, the Expert has become a quick study, refuses to acknowledge her limitations, and looks beyond the veil of appearance in pursuit of the naked face of the truth.

#### Intuition
Intuition is the defining attribute of the Expert. It describes her innate sense of the working of things and the immediate world. It allows her to anticipate the actions of her friends and foes, to quickly grasp the methods and mechanisms of the material world, and to open herself up to the favors of chance. Experts begin with 3 points of Intuition

#### People, Places, Things
Experts begin with three special assets which epitomize the nature and history of their expertise. In the course of their life, Experts develop an inexplicable connection between a mundane object or tool, a friend or pet, and a place. Without these allies, safe havens and lucky charms, the Expert would never have amounted to anything more than a tinker, a dabbler, a master of none.
